## This blog was bootstrapped with Create React App and uses awesome tecnologies, such:

- ReactJS
- Firebase

The purpose is to test new technologies like Firebase, which has an incredible real-time database, storage and authentication service. I really liked this application because I learned a lot of tools.

Live Demo for App is at https://spiderblog.netlify.app

Setup:

- run npm install or yarn install to install, and then npm start or yarn start to run the project.
